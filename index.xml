      <description>Abstract Text to speech (TTS) has made rapid progress in both academia and industry in recent years. Some questions naturally arise that whether a TTS system can achieve human-level quality, how to define/judge human-level quality and how to achieve it. In this paper, we answer these questions by first defining the criterion of human-level quality based on statistical significance of measurement and describing the guidelines to judge it, and then proposing a TTS system called NaturalSpeech that achieves human-level quality on a benchmark dataset.</description>
